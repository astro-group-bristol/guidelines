# Astro Group Bristol Guidelines

This repository contains some general information and coding practices within the organization.

## Creating new repositories

All members have default read permissions for repositories, however this still allows you to create new repositories under the organization. Repositories you create are controlled by *you*, and are managed similarly to how you would manage your own personal repositories.

Collaborators need to be invited, even if they are members of the Astro Group Bristol. 

Creating repositories for your own code is perfectly acceptable always. If you wish to create a public repository for the group, e.g. `short-data-analysis-scripts` for dumping commonly used code snippets, please discuss with the other members beforehand to gauge the interest and use.

## Workflows

We have 3000 free minutes of GitHub Workflows per month. Please configure workflows to use minimal time if possible. This can be done by only triggering a work flow on specific branches, aborting early if something goes wrong, only running tests if code files have been changed, etc.
