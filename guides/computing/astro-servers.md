# Astro group servers

For getting the most out of the servers, see [Usage](../astro-servers-usage.md).

## Getting access (for members of the department only)

Ask Rhys Morris.

Servers available:

- `aquila` (Login Server â€“ can log in to this without UoB VPN and access other servers from there)
- `typhon` (CDT priority, has a GPU)
- `trappist` (Zoe's group priority)
- `mensa`
- `cetus` (Ubuntu, cannot be accessed though Aquila, you must be on university network or VPN)

Load look-up (not working): [Load look-up](https://www.star.bris.ac.uk/local/notes/servers.html)

For the local page with more information about software and others see: [star.bris.ac.uk](https://www.star.bris.ac.uk/local/)

How to login:

```bash
ssh username@<server-name>.star.bris.ac.uk
```

You will then be promoted to enter your password.
